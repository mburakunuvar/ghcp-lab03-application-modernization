# Application Modernization with Github Copilot 
## - Java edition

## Welcome



- **Who is this for:** Java developers looking to modernize and migrate applications to Azure.
- **What you'll learn:** How to use GitHub Copilot to upgrade Java runtimes, assess cloud readiness, and generate unit tests.
- **Prerequisites:** Familiarity with Java and VS Code; a GitHub account with Codespaces access.
- **How long:** This lab takes approximately 1–2 hours to complete.

## How to start this exercise

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do **not** fork or clone this repo directly. Use **Copy Exercise** below to get your own clean copy, so that the Codespace badge and step instructions point to your repository.

 Click **Copy Exercise** :

[![Copy Exercise](https://img.shields.io/badge/Copy%20Exercise-green?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/new?template_owner=mburakunuvar&template_name=ghcp-lab03-application-modernization&owner=%40me&name=lab03-application-modernization&description=Exercise:+Application+Modernization+with+GitHub+Copilot&visibility=public)

After copying, wait a few seconds and refresh your new repository page. A GitHub Actions workflow will automatically personalize the Codespaces badge for your repository.

## Prerequisites- Codespaces Setup 

1. **Right click** the **Open in GitHub Codespaces** button below and open the **Create Codespace** page in a new tab. 

   [![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/{{full_repo_name}}?quickstart=1)

1. Confirm the **Repository** field is your copy of the exercise, not the original : 

   - ✅ Your copy: `/{{full_repo_name}}`
   - ❌ Original: `/mburakunuvar/ghcp-lab03-application-modernizationz`

   Make selections below and then click the green **Create Codespace** button and proceed with default options. You can also click **Check Options** first to cross-check if the configuration matches the screenshot below and the creation.

   </p>

1. Wait a moment for Visual Studio Code to load in your browser. Please be patient, it's deploying all the packages and necessary extensions for the lab. 


It'll take 3-4 minutes for your online base VS Code to be provisioned with all required packages and extentions for the lab. This lab follows the [Quickstart: assess and migrate a Java project using GitHub Copilot modernization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/java/migration/migrate-github-copilot-app-modernization-for-java-quickstart-assess-migrate?toc=/azure/developer/github-copilot-app-modernization). You will work with  GitHub Copilot modernization extension, run an AppCAT-powered cloud readiness assessment on a sample Java project, and then apply a predefined migration task — for example, switching an Azure SQL database connection from username/password to Azure Managed Identity. The lab also covers the automated validation loop (CVE checks, build fixes, consistency checks, and unit test generation) that Copilot runs after applying code changes.


1. Once ready, enter the prompts below to ask Copilot to introduce you to the project. Don't let the agent make any changes - yet 😊

We'll be using [GitHub Copilot modernization](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.migrate-java-to-azure) which is a comprehensive curated custom agent tailored for Java modernization and Azure migrations


## Step 1 — Upgrade JDK and dependency versions

Upgrade your Java runtime and third-party dependencies (e.g. Spring Boot) using the **GitHub Copilot modernization** panel in VS Code.

👉 Full instructions: [steps/1-step.md](steps/1-step.md)

## Step 2 — Assess cloud readiness

Run an AppCAT-powered assessment to identify migration blockers before moving your app to Azure. The assessment produces a categorized report with recommended remediation steps.

👉 Full instructions: [steps/2-step.md](steps/2-step.md)

## Step 3 — Generate unit test cases

Use the GitHub Copilot modernization pane to automatically generate unit tests and produce a TestReport comparing results before and after.

### Samples:

- [mi-sql-public-demo](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/java-migration-copilot-samples/tree/main/mi-sql-public-demo) : Getting started sample that migrates an app to use Managed Identities instead of password.

- [rabbitmq-sender](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/java-migration-copilot-samples/tree/main/rabbitmq-sender) : Getting started sample application that sends messages to a RabbitMQ message broker. Demonstrate creating and applying your own custom migration formulas.

- [asset manager](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/java-migration-copilot-samples/tree/main/asset-manager) : This is a complete workshop with an end-to-end scenario that migrates an app to Azure using predefined and custom formulas. After the migration, the app will run on Azure Container Apps and interact with Azure Blob, Azure Service Bus and Azure Database for PostgreSQL.

- [Todo Web API with Oracle Database](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/java-migration-copilot-samples/tree/main/todo-web-api-use-oracle-db) A To-do application using Oracle database for storage. It leverages Oracle-specific SQL features and data types, for instance, VARCHAR2. This sample migrates the application to use Azure Database for PostgreSQL instead.

- [Student Web App - Jakarta EE](jakarta-ee/student-web-app) A Java EE web application running on Open Liberty with a hybrid architecture that supports both traditional servlets and Spring MVC. The application manages student profiles with CRUD operations and demonstrates migrating from Ant to Maven and Java EE to Jakarta EE.
